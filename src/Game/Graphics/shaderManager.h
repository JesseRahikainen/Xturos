/*
We're assuming some things about the shaders.
Naming conventions: The equivilant attributes that shaders use will have the same name. So all vertex positions will
  have the same name, all vertex normals will have the same name, etc. We can then extend that as we need more
  attributes.
  Uniforms will act similarly.
  This will allow us to use a generic kind of binding.
  Note: For very special cases we should be able to ignore all this. So we should have a list of general ones that
        we will use alot, and then a way to define custom ones.
