Create a list of steps needed to start a project from fresh

Frame based animations - copy existing stuff, allow offsets per frame (maybe just use Spine for this?)
Come up with some way to configure and store OpenGL states, so we can make sure everything is in order when starting to render specific things
Child states, hfsm
Optional switch for having a locked graphics update rate (must always be >= gameplay fps), would be easier if it was a multiple of the gameplay fps
Render to image
Full support for UTF-8 strings.

eventually:
Find a better way to enumerate all the combinations of stuff that can go into a render instruction.
See what OpenGL features are actually needed and downgrade the version to support that
Add in ability to cope with the amount of texture memory the computer has (basically make sure the next image can fit, if it can't then exit with a log), maybe store the max we're going to use and test it when the program starts so they don't get a crash in the middle of playing. Just pre-allocate how much we'll think we need and then use it up as we get more, can be mixed in with the atlasing.
Turn off multi-threaded dll library (may need to rebuild all the SDL2 based libraries)  http://forums.libsdl.org/viewtopic.php?t=9634&sid=917224a793e6a71f05b1c7ed49120797
Better file loading scheme, avoid locks, some sort of queue system so we can say what we want loaded and use some placeholder asset until it's fully loaded

continuous:
- Generally try to get rid of external libraries, except for SDL2, use STB whenever possible
- Go through all the log messages and enforce some sort of standards: stuff we want in debug builds versus stuff we want release builds.
Will want three levels: Release, Development, and Debug.
Map these to SDL_LOG_PRIORITY_INFO, SDL_LOG_PRIORITY_DEBUG, and SDL_LOG_PRIORITY_VERBOSE.
Use SDL_LOG_PRIORITY_INFO for any messages we want sent out no matter what.
Use SDL_LOG_PRIORITY_DEBUG for more detailed data for info level logs and extra to help trace what's happening.
Use SDL_LOG_PRIORITY_VERBOSE for log spam and other such things that might effect performance.
Have this configurable, so we can switch it on the fly.
